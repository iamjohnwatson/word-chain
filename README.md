# Word Chain Challenge

Word Chain Challenge is an interactive word association game where players build chains of related words. Test your vocabulary and creative thinking as you link words together to form a continuous chain.

## üéÆ How to Play

1. **Start with the given word** and build a chain of 10 related words
2. **Each word must be logically related to the previous one**
3. You'll see a target word - you don't have to reach it directly, but doing so gives you bonus points!
4. Earn points for:
   - Using rare words
   - Responding quickly
   - Maintaining streaks
   - Reaching the target word
5. Use hints if you get stuck (costs points)

## ‚ú® Features

- **Interactive word cards**: Click on any word to see its definition
- **Leaderboards**: Daily, weekly, and all-time high scores

## üß† Game Mechanics

### Word Relationships
Words are considered related if they appear in the ConceptNet database with a "RelatedTo" relationship. This creates natural, intuitive connections between words.

### Scoring System
- **Base word score**: Based on word length and letter rarity
- **Speed bonus**: Faster responses earn additional points
- **Streak bonus**: Consecutive successful words increase your multiplier
- **Target word bonus**: Reaching the target word gives a significant bonus
- **Difficulty multiplier**: Higher difficulties multiply your score

### Hint System
- **Level 1**: Shows the first letter of a valid word (-5 points)
- **Level 2**: Shows a pattern revealing some letters (-10 points)
- **Level 3**: Directly suggests multiple valid words (-20 points)

## üß™ Future Improvements

- Add multiplayer mode
- Implement themed word chains (animals, food, etc.)
- Add more languages
- Create custom word packs
- Implement user accounts for cross-device progress
